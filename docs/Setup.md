# Set Up Your Development Environment

We support three development environments for this tutorial: Linux, Windows, and Docker.

We highly recommend that you use the Docker instructions if possible, because the
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) environment will be exactly the same for everyone
following the tutorial and we are able to thoroughly test it. This means it's the least
likely to have unexpected issues. 

Docker works on *both* Linux and Window host systems, but the installation of Docker is
different on each host system. We include instructions to install Docker on both hosts.

## Environment Options

Pick the instructions below that matches the environment you would like to set up. You
should follow the setup instructions for your environment before moving on to the
[next section](#recommendations-for-all-platforms).
