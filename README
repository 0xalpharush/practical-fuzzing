# Practical Fuzzing

This repository contains practical fuzzing guides for various techniques and
applications of different fuzzers. As much as possible, the tutorials here try to cover
all the necessary information to follow them without assuming prior knowledge.

    - [LibAFL](#libafl)
  - [Reporting Issues](#reporting-issues)


## Building and Reading the Documentation

To build the documentation, install [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook). Then:

```sh
mdbook build
```

The book will be build in the `book` subdirectory of this repository.

To read the book locally, run:

```sh
mdbook serve
```

And navigate to the page `mdbook` tells you to (probably
[https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000)).

## Useful Resources

No training can be completely exhaustive, so you may find these resources useful
throughout in order to understand various Fuzzing, Rust, LibAFL, and other concepts.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter *any* issues or uncertainty while working through this training, please
contact [Rowan Hart (rowan.hart@intel.com)](mailto:rowan.hart@intel.com) and/or file an
issue in this repository. The goal with this training is not to provide a framework for
learning LibAFL yourself, it is to give you a totally complete guide, so anything
missing or incomplete is considered a breaking bug.
