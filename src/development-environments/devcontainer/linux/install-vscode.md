# Install VSCode

For all platforms, we recommend using the [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
Integrated Development Environment. It is the best supported IDE for Rust development
and provides the best experience for this training.

You can download VSCode [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for your platform and
install it.

In VSCode, the following extensions are highly recommended to enable the most efficient
Rust development environment possible:

- [Rust Analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer)
- [Even Better TOML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tamasfe.even-better-toml)
- [Crates](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=serayuzgur.crates)
- [Remote Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack)
