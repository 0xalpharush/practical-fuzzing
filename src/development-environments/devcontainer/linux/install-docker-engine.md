# Install Docker Engine

To set up a Linux host to follow this training, you need to first install Docker Engine.

You can find installation instructions
at [docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for your distribution. Note
you should install *Docker Engine*, not *Docker Desktop*. For some distributions, you can
follow these quick links:

- [Debian](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/)
- [Fedora](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/fedora/)
- [CentOS](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/centos/)
- [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)

For other architectures, follow the link above and check Docker's documentation.
