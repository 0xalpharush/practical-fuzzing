# Rust Lexicon

Rust has a few terms we should get familiar with before we get started using it. For any
language-specific terminology not listed here, you can consult the
[Rust glossary](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/glossary.html)

- `crate`: A `crate` is to Rust as a package is to Python or Java, or a library for
  C/C++. Unlike C/C++, a `crate` can be a library *or* a binary. Crates can have
  dependencies, and can import and export entities including functions, structures,
  types and enumerations.
