# Launch the Fuzzer

We can now launch the fuzzer by running:

```sh
$ cargo run --release -- -c corpus -s solutions
```

The fuzzer should run, then exit somewhat quickly (again, this is a very easy target).

You'll see some output like:

```

```

This means we have reached an objective! Notice that this fuzzer runs very fast, not
even 1 second for our 2179 executions. Speed is a major advantage of LibAFL over AFL++
and other fuzzers, because reaching this speed on a single core in AFL++ is non-trivial
and requires work, whereas with LibAFL we can hit this kind of speed with the simplest
possible fuzzer!
