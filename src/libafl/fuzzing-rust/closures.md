# Closures

Closures in rust are similar to *lambdas* in both Python and C++, and to a lesser extent
function pointers in C. They are anonymous functions that optionally capture data from
their surrounding scope (or, as the documentation calls it, their *environment*).
The full scope of capabilities of closures is large and complex, so you are encouraged
to read the [Closures Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch13-01-closures.html).
