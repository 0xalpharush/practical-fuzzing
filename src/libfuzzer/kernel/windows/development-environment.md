# Development Environment

This tutorial should be followed in the [Windows Kernel
Development](../../../development-environments/virtual-machine/windows-kernel/README.md)
virtual machine. Set up a virtual machine as described in that tutorial. Building and
running HEVD on your host machine is *not* recommended, because the tutorial will guide
you through crashing the kernel which will blue-screen the virtual machine (and would 
blue-screen your host machine if run on it directly).
